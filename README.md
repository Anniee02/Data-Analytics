# Data-Analytics
Our project is a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 using Tableau software. It focuses on the time period of January 2020 to March 2020 and aims to provide insights into the spread and impact of the virus during that time frame. 
The project incorporates 10 different visualizations, each designed to highlight specific aspects of the COVID-19 data. These visualizations include charts, graphs, maps, and other visual representations, all created using Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities.
